# JSFX-Reaper-Pack
My Pack of JSFX for Reaper.


## List of JSFX
- *High Frequency Thickener* : aka HFT, high frequency limiter which give an analog touch to the mix;
- *Simple Volume Slider* : a simple volume slider can always be useful;


## Disclaimer!
This is a JSFX and it is meant to be used in REAPER. JSFX are simple text files, which become full featured plug-ins when loaded into REAPER.

### How to install JS Plugins

[Quick tutorial by 'The Reaper Blog'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EegrN-gF5o)

After downloading a JS plugin, add the files into the Effects folder of REAPER‚Äôs resource folder, then scan for new plugins.
You can quickly find the resource folder from REAPER in the options menu, ‚ÄúShow REAPER‚Äôs resource path in explorer/finder‚Ä¶‚Äù

## Some final considerations
I'm a student and an audio nerd. I do this just for fun and practice. I use Reaper almost daily so I found easier to develop my ideas in JesuSonic. I planning to develop some VSTs in C++ too in the future. For now, I find more time-efficient coding in JS. 

Being a free-time-project, don't expect daily updates. If you find any bugs, or if you have any suggestions for improvements, feel free to report them in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/emainta/JSFX-Reaper-Pack/issues), I'll have a look there every now and then.

Peace & Love ü•∞
